PROJECT MEETING SUMMARY: BAYESIAN NETWORK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE
November 17th Meeting

OVERVIEW
The team presented significant progress on their Bayesian network project, including dataset selection, exploratory data analysis, and critical technical decisions about network structure. The meeting focused on validating the team's approach against published research and determining methods for conditional probability table estimation.

DATA AND DATASET PROGRESS

Dataset Selection Completed
- Converted original data from .data file to CSV using Python
- Dataset cleaned and ready for analysis
- 303 patient records with 14 selected attributes
- Source is credible cardiovascular disease literature

Selected Attributes (14 total)
- Age, gender, smoking, alcohol intake
- Resting blood pressure (systolic and diastolic)
- Cholesterol, glucose levels
- Chest pain types (typical angina, atypical angina, asymptomatic)
- Maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced chest pain, ST depression
- Target: cardiovascular disease severity (0-4 scale)

Scale Explanation
0 = no cardiovascular disease
1 = mild disease presence
2-3 = moderate disease
4 = extremely severe disease

CRITICAL TECHNICAL CLARIFICATION

Decision Tree vs. Bayesian Network Decision
The team confirmed they are building a Bayesian network, not a decision tree. This distinction matters significantly:

Decision Trees
- Use sequential, linear rules
- One path leads to one outcome
- Less suitable for complex interdependencies

Bayesian Networks
- Model probabilistic relationships
- Multiple variables can influence outcomes
- Variables link bidirectionally
- Can represent complex causality
- Better suited to medical diagnosis where multiple factors interact

Why This Matters for CPTs
One connection line in a Bayesian network does not equal one probability value. If node A (asthma) links to node C (oxygen level) and node B (pneumonia) also links to C, then the connection must account for all combinations:
- Asthma positive, pneumonia positive
- Asthma positive, pneumonia negative
- Asthma negative, pneumonia positive
- Asthma negative, pneumonia negative
This creates a table, not a simple line probability.

NETWORK STRUCTURE DEVELOPED

5-Tier Hierarchical Model
Tier 1 (Root Causes): Age, gender, lifestyle factors
Tier 2 (Intermediate): Blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose
Tier 3 (Clinical Factors): Symptom types, exercise tolerance
Tier 4 (Exercise Response): Exercise-induced symptoms, ST depression
Tier 5 (Target): Cardiovascular disease outcome

Relationship Example
Age increases with higher chance of elevated cholesterol, which increases chest pain likelihood, which raises cardiovascular disease probability.

Validation Process
- Team reviewed research papers showing similar structures
- Confirmed connections have medical basis, not just mathematical correlation
- Example validation: does gender actually influence resting blood pressure (medically justified)?

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS COMPLETED

Correlation Heatmap Analysis
Using pandas and seaborn libraries:
- Chest pain shows 0.41 positive correlation with disease presence
- Generated correlation matrix showing all variable relationships
- Identified strong correlations supporting network structure
- Purpose: verify that hypothesized relationships exist in actual data

Medical Plausibility Analysis
Created separate document explaining:
- Why each variable was selected
- Medical reasoning for each connection
- Supporting research references
- Addressing why certain attributes matter

How Correlations Support Network Design
If correlation analysis shows strong relationship between two variables, it provides mathematical backing for including them as connected nodes in the Bayesian network. Weak correlations may indicate unnecessary connections.

CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY TABLE METHODS

Three CPT Estimation Approaches Identified

Method 1: Maximum Likelihood Estimation
- Available in PGMPY Python library
- Formula: (count of specific case) / (total population)
- Example: (people with high cholesterol AND cardiovascular disease) / (total people) = probability
- Mathematical and straightforward
- Automatically calculated from data

Method 2: Value Binning with Ranges
- Break continuous variables into bins
- Age binned as: <40, 40-60, >60
- Calculate separate probabilities for each bin
- Create discrete lookup tables
- Used in published research papers reviewed

Method 3: Greedy Hill-Climbing Algorithm
- Statistical learning approach to find optimal network structure
- Uses conditional dependence measures
- Identifies which relationships are most important
- Multinomial distributions for probability calculation
- More complex but potentially more accurate

From Literature Example
Paper showed probability table for oxygen level prediction:
Age <60: 0.6 probability
Age 60-80: 0.2 probability
Age >80: 0.2 probability

This demonstrates binning method clearly.

RESEARCH PAPERS AND COMPARISONS

Papers Reviewed
1. Development and Validation of Bayesian Network Predicting Coronary Heart Disease Risk
2. Two versions of networks from same research (initial and expert-validated versions)
3. Papers showing both structure diagrams and probability estimation methods

Key Findings
- Papers used 13 attributes (team using 14, close match)
- Expert-validated networks showed refinements from initial versions
- Different network structures in different papers, but same general approach
- All papers clearly documented probability estimation methodology

Advisor Guidance on Research Integration
- Consider adopting network structures from published papers
- Avoid reinventing relationships already established medically
- If team's network differs from papers, must justify with strong medical evidence
- Alternatively, use published network with team's dataset

PROBABILITY DEFENSIBILITY CONCERNS

Critical Questions Raised by Advisor

Concern 1: Mathematical vs. Medical Meaning
- Can maximum likelihood estimation accurately capture medical relationships?
- Just because math finds correlation does not mean causal relationship exists
- Weak correlation might be included mathematically but not medically relevant

Concern 2: Assumption of Relationships
- Assuming age influences cholesterol without verified medical basis
- Need proof that relationship is significant and directional
- Cannot assume all correlations represent true causality

Concern 3: Arbitrary Probability Assignment
- Cannot assign probabilities based on intuition
- Every CPT value must have documented source
- Must explain: "This is 0.7 because [data shows] or [literature says]"

Advisor's Recommendation
- Every connection must have medical justification
- Every probability must have mathematical or medical backing
- Document methodology completely for publication

KEY INSIGHTS FROM DISCUSSION

Network vs. Tree Understanding
Team member stated: "A network means a single line has multiple variations of values. A decision tree means one line represents one probabilistic value."

This is the fundamental distinction driving all technical decisions.

Circular Networks are Acceptable
Papers reviewed showed networks that were not strictly hierarchical (had circular paths). This validated the team's complex structure.

One Line, Multiple Probabilities
The breakthrough understanding that connections cannot have single probabilities changed approach significantly. This explains why CPT tables exist separate from connection lines.

Probability Formula Discovery
Team identified formula structure for CPT calculation and recognized it involves multiplication of probabilities, aligning with Bayesian probability theory.

OUTSTANDING TECHNICAL QUESTIONS

1. Should team develop custom network or adapt published structure?
2. Which CPT estimation method provides best medical accuracy?
3. How to balance mathematical rigor with medical plausibility?
4. Can maximum likelihood estimation capture nuanced medical relationships?
5. How many probability bins are necessary for continuous variables?
